wrapper: detect OS version: probably uname(3): warn non-Darwin
wrapper: switch 10.6 to detach "detach from console" from 10.6's screen patch?
    We want to move to newer "detach from console" function just in
    case the "move subset to user" one is removed in a future
    release (even if the idea of "detach to reattach (to the user
    bootstrap namespace)" seems odd).
